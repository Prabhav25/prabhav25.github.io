# Portfolio

## 1)Abstract

Being a web developer by profession it is very important for a web developer to have a portfolio which helps hiim to provide an overview of the projects and to showcase the skills and achievements. In today's scenario most of the students have their portfolio copied or forked but being a web developer I have created my portfolio by myself. In this portfolio project I have used tech stack <b>HTML/CSS and JavaScript</b>. The most important thing is, this portfolio is fully responsive with different screen sizes. The code is optimized and written in such a way that some other person can easily understand it. It is made possible because of the commments included explaining the process and the meaning of the code used line by line.

## 2)Platform

Here I have used Visual Studio Code which is one of the best platform for web development. Here I have downloaded extension Live Server which helps to launch a local server with live reload feature for both static and dynamic pages.

## 3)Model

<b>SDLC</b> model has been used to create this portfolio. SDLC stand for Software Development Life Cycle model.  
The first phase is the Requirement phase, where we focuses on the requirements of the client from the product. So here my requirements were, a portfolio which is fully responsive, has smooth scrolling and looks attractive. It should contain projects, publications, skills, achievements, courses etc.  
The second phase is the Design phase, in order to create a design I ceated a rough sketch on a paper to know hoe my portfolio should look like. Design can also be changed based on the requirements.  
The third phase is Implementation phase, so here whole front-end was created where we added different break points for different screen sizes to achive responsiveness. Here all the things were taken into consideration like how to create a smooth website, the text and colourss to be used, the layout of the website and then implemented.  
The fourth phase is the Testing phase, here the whole code was tested and all the things were corrected if there was an error or warning.  
The fifth phase is the Deployment phase, so I have deployed my website on GitHub.  
The sixth phase is the Maintenance phase, so this website has to be properly maintained.
